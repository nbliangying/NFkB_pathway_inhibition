# NFkB Pathway Inhibition

An extension of the LINCS_target_prediction project - we apply the target prediction pipeline to the LINCS L1000 gene expression dataset to look for potential inhibitors of the canonical NFkB pathway.

The **TRAF2_final_correlation_analysis.ipynb** notebook explores the gene expression data for two predicted and validated TRAF2/5 inhibitors. Sepcifically, we compare the perturbational mRNA signatures of these compounds along with negative controls to the knockdown signatures of TRAF2 and the proteins involved in the canonical NFkB pathway.

The **expression_signature_visualization.ipynb** notebook explores a new way of visualizing the correlation data introduced in TRAF2_final_correlation_analysis.
